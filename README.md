Please aware, this is not a complete reference of every payload commerce tools can handle plus it is not even official.

As I work as a project manager for commerce tools projects I always need to understand the possibilities of endpoints
and found different resources for the json payloads of this wonderful api.

To give myself a better understanding of commercetools and my development team a better resource to look into I just
started creating this repository. Its basically an aggregation of every (currently) available resource.

If you find something changed or missing, feel free to add push changes, I gonna merge them.


Thx,
Emtii
